# Didact

A system for easily printing / formatting spell, item, and monster cards for D&D and other roleplaying games. Eventually.

# Goals
- Let me plop text into a file, in some kind of format (was doing markdown, but maybe markdown with yml frontmatter?)
- Format each distinct thing as a card
- Put all those cards on a printable page
- As time allows, make the cards fancy and stuff

# Notes
- Card size: 3.5" x 2.5" with 1/8" radius
- Info in cards.md is from the 5e SRD
